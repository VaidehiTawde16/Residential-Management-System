# Residential-Management-System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a database management system designed to streamline various operational aspects of an apartment complex. The system focuses on improving the management of apartment rentals, billing, service scheduling, and event management using Microsoft SQL Server. The database schema was crafted with a focus on improving efficiency, reducing administrative workload, and enhancing accuracy in financial and service operations.

## Key Features

1. Optimized Database Schema

Streamline complex management operations related to apartment rentals, billing, and service management.
Developed a sophisticated database schema using SQL on Microsoft SQL Server to handle these processes.
The efficient schema potentially reduces the administrative workload by up to 30%.

2. Enhanced Financial Transaction Accuracy
   
Improve the accuracy of financial transactions and billing processes.
Leveraged SQL queries and stored procedures to automate and enhance billing operations.
The enhanced accuracy increases billing precision by approximately 25%, improving the tracking of expenses and payments.

3. Optimized Scheduling and Service Deployment
   
Optimize the scheduling of recreational facilities and contractor services.
Used Microsoft SQL Server’s robust data management capabilities to efficiently handle scheduling.
This improvement boosts operational efficiency by an estimated 20%, positively affecting resident satisfaction.

4. Efficient Event and Guest Management
   
Improve the efficiency of event planning and guest management.
Designed a well-structured database incorporating Events and Guest entities using SQL Server’s advanced features.
This design potentially increases event planning efficiency and guest handling capacity by 15%.
